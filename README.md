After the findings from this election was found, we can see that the data is accurate. With thisscript it is easy to read and precise on the places and people who voted for their candidates. With some modification we can use this scrip to see results for other things as well, for example for presidential election (example 1)  if we were to look at the total number of votes casted by each state instead of counties and if we want to narrow the candidates to just two we can do this and get more accurate results. Also if we want to find out the number of people that are eligible to vote ( example 2 ) but did / did not choose to vote , we can do so by subtracting the total votes from the population of eligible voters.
